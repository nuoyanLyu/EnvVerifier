    """
    ScienceWorld environment wrapper that provides a Docker-based interface to the ScienceWorld simulator.

    This class manages a Docker container running the ScienceWorld environment and provides
    an async interface for interacting with science experiments. The container is configured
    with security restrictions and resource limits for safe execution.

    Attributes:
        image (str): Docker image name for the ScienceWorld environment
        runtime (str): Docker runtime to use (default: "runc")
        cpu (int): Number of CPU cores allocated to the container
        mem (str): Memory limit for the container (e.g., "2g")
        start_timeout (float): Maximum time to wait for container startup
        max_episodes (int): Maximum number of episodes allowed
        container_port (int): Port inside the container (default: 2700)
        host_ip (str): Host IP for port binding (default: "127.0.0.1")
        score (float): Current score for the active episode
        _client (httpx.AsyncClient): HTTP client for communicating with the container

    Example:
        ```python
        env = ScienceWorldEnv()
        await env.start()
        await env.reset({'task_name': 'boil', 'variation_idx': 0})
