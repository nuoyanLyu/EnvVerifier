    Calculate reward for chess puzzle solving based on Stockfish evaluation.

    This reward function provides:
    1. Dense reward based on move quality (centipawn evaluation)
    2. Bonus for solving the puzzle correctly
    3. Penalty for making suboptimal moves

    The reward is structured to encourage:
    - Finding the best moves (matching Stockfish recommendations)
    - Solving puzzles completely
    - Making progress even with imperfect moves

        final_response (str): The agent's final response/output (not used directly).
        env (ChessPuzzleEnv): The chess puzzle environment instance.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing:
            - reward (float): The calculated reward value (0.0 to 1.0+)
            - is_solved (bool): Whether the puzzle was solved correctly
            - moves_made (int): Number of moves made
            - best_move_matches (int): How many moves matched Stockfish's best move
            - centipawn_score (float): Average centipawn quality of moves (0-100 scale)
