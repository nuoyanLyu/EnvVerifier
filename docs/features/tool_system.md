# Tool System

## Unifying Interfaces with Tool Call

Tool calling are becoming stardards for LM agents. We use *tool* as an abstractive concept that represent all *functions*, *tools*, *APIs*, *environments*, etc. Therefore, agent rollout is unified as a repeatitive process of generation and tool calling. However, there are some challenges that we need to tackle for RL rollout:

1. Parallelism: To ensure efficiency, during the rollout we need to have multiple interactions in parallel. This requires the tool can be called in parallel. In AgentFly (and many other frameworks), this is achieved through *asynchronous pipeline*: All of **generation, tool calling, and reward calculation are designed to be asynchronous**.

2. Isolation: Some environments need to be isolated during the interaction (e.g. writing files in an os). We mainly achieve this through running **multiple docker containers**.

### Definition

We have designed three ways to define tools:

1. Using `@tool` to define the tool
```python
from agentfly.tools import tool

@tool(name="tool name", description="Description about the tool)
async def custom_tool(arg1, arg2):
    """
    Description about the tool.

    Args:
        arg1: arg1 of the tool
        arg2: arg2 of the tool

    Returns:
        An observation string.
    """
    # tool logic here
    observation = "This is the return"
    return observation
```

2. Inheriting from the `BaseTool` class. The tool execution interface is the call method of the class.
```python
from agentfly.tools import BaseTool
class APITool(BaseTool)
    name="api_tool"
    description="This is a tool that uses API key"

    def __init__(self, api_key):
        self.api_key = api_key

    def call(self, query):
        """
        This is a tool that uses API key

        Args:
            query (str): query to use for the tool

        Returns:
            observation: observation string
        """

        return f"Call with query {query} and key {self.api_key}"
```


3. A specialized tool that can be directly defined as the method of the agent. This is recommended for specialized agent.
```python
from agentfly.agents import BaseAgent

class CustomAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, special_api_key, **kwargs):
        self.special_api_key = special_api_key
        super().__init__(**kwargs)

    def processing_query(self, query):
        return query

    @tool(name="specialized_tool")
    async def specialized_tool(self, query: str):
        query = self.processing_query(query)
        result = f"Call query {query} with special api key: {self.special_api_key}"

        return result
```




## Non-Stateful & Stateful Tool
We define two types of tools:

1. Non-Stateful Tool does not keep environment states. For such tool, we can simply write a function and decorate it with `@tool`.

    ```python
    @tool(name="AdditionTool", description="Adds two numbers.")
        def add(a, b: int = 1):
            """
            Adds two numbers.

            Args:
                a (int): The first number.
                b (int): The second number which should be a non-negative integer.

            Returns:
                int: The sum of a and b.
            """
            return a + b
    ```

2. Stateful Tool keeps the environmental states. In definition, we need to specify an environment class (`env_cls`), and the pool size. The resource system will initialize the number of pool size environment instances. When calling the tool, it will require an instance from the central resource system, and will later release it back to the pool. Inside the tool, we can use the environment by calling the `step` method, which is generally the interface to interact with environment. For example, for `PythonSandboxEnv`, the `step` method accepts a code string, executing it and return anything on stdout or stderr.

    ```python
    @tool(env_cls=PythonSandboxEnv, name="code_interpreter", description="Run the code in docker container and return the output from stdout or stderr", stateful=True, pool_size=16)
    async def code_interpreter(code: str, env: PythonSandboxEnv):
        """
        Run the code in docker container and return the output from stdout or stderr
        Args:
            code (str): The code to run.
        Returns:
            str: The output from stdout or stderr
        """
        try:
            obs = await env.step(code)
            return obs
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Error: {str(e)}\n{traceback.format_exc()}"
    ```

## Tool Calling

### Asynchronous
Tool call are defined to be asynchronous for efficiency. Use `async` to define the tool. Note that defining a tool to be asynchronous is not just about using `async` keyword. The actual operation inside the tool call should be asynchronous.

!!! note
    A tool can also be defined to be synchronous in AgentFly. Although it might be slow for training.

### Isolation
When calling the tool, if it is a stateful tool, we need to specify an `id` argument for environment isolation. Calling with different `id`s are ensured to make use of different environment instances, while same `id` will use the same environment. A call with a new `id` will consume an environment instance in the pool, until it is released. **If there is no instance inside the pool, new call will be stuck until instances are released back to the pool.**

```python
result = await code_interpreter("print('Hello World')", id="12345")
await code_interpreter.release(id="12345")
```
