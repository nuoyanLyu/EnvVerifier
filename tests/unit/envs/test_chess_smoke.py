# test_chess_smoke.py
"""
End-to-end smoke test for the chess puzzle agent pipeline.

Verifies that ReactAgent + chess tools + chess reward work together:
- Agent receives a puzzle
- Tools dispatch to ChessPuzzleEnv
- Trajectories are populated after run()
- Reward function produces a valid result

Requires: Stockfish installed (brew install stockfish / apt-get install stockfish)
